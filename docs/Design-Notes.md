# Design Notes for the Terminus Geospatial Toolbox

This is more of an SDK with included app, rather than just an application. 

In order to get a mildly functional app that wasn't too painful to expand upon, I decided to literally just recreate many of the components you'd find in a normal SDK. 

- Advanced Math API
- UI / GUI App
- Geospatial API
- Webservice API
